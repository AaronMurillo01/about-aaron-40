    <p>
        I am an optimistic and outgoing individual. Aside from work, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places because it gives you the motivation to do something new. In my opinion, it is advisable to treat others in the same manner in which you would like to be treated(Golden Rule).

<p>I am an <em>fun</em> person to hangout with.<br> </p>
